IMPROVEMENTS:
(not done due time limitation)
- background and environtment scene (3d: skybox, house, fence, some background forest...)
- background plates for menu items
- help/about screen
- improved animations (set overlapping movements)
- sparks (particle emitter) when element placed on stage (paint)
- Loading screen (waiting for Pixi+3D scenes to load sprites/textures/objects)
- [bug] when drag (rotate view) = cancel click (prevent to paint on mouseup)
- [bug?] change three+pixi integration (render 3d to SpriteTexture)
    (currently approach does not allows "pixi filter" to work properly - due to 3d background)

[ this test/project was done in less than 2days (between christmas holidays) ... no IA involved ]
